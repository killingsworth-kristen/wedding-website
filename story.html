            <h2 class="title">First Date - May 2018</h2>
            <p class="story">We went bowling for our first date after meeting online. During the date Kristen lost her phone, which if you know Kristen is very on brand. Corey and Kristen went through the usual steps ("can you call me from your phone?"). After the phone was found on an arcade machine, Kristen tried to redeem some semblance of coolness and said "At least you have my number now." She was so smooth with it that Corey thought she had manufactured the whole "lost phone" debacle until he realized later that, Kristen just loses things often! At the end of the date, after a firm and very chaste handshake (which Kristen found absolutely charming and adorable) they got in their cars to go home. Not having realized they lived 2 miles away, Corey left first and Kristen followed. After realizing they were going the same direction, Kristen started to panic that Corey would think she was some crazy stalker chick and following him home, luckily she turned off on her street first.</p>
